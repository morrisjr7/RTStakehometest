**#1**   integerabovebelow.py which accepts a single positional integer argument and prints the elements above and below it in the file. Also, accepts two optional keyword arguments where a custom array can be used and a flag --include_equal which prints the number of values equal to the target integer in the array.

e.g. : python integerabovebelow.py 6

     above: 1, below: 4

e.g. : python integerabovebelow.py 6 --array='1,43,4,32,2,5,623,45,54325,54,4,6,4,6'

    above:6 below:6
e.g. : python integerabovebelow.py 6 --array='1,43,4,32,2,5,623,45,54325,54,4,6,4,6' --include_equal

    above:6 below:6 equal:2
    
    

**#2** rotatestring.py rotates a string by a given number of steps and prints the output.

e.g. :  python rotatestring.py 'RTS Labs' 2
    
    bsRTS La
e.g. :  python rotatestring.py 'RTS Labs' -2

    S LabsRT

e.g. :  python rotatestring.py 'RTS Labs' 345345

    sRTS Lab



**#3** If I could change one feature about Python it would be the addition of switch statements. Coming from Java I was quite disappointed that there was no case/switch style structure. Ultimately, I ended up making due with dictionaries but case/switch would come in handy in many projects.
